STYLE GUIDE FOR POKEMONGO

--- Variable and naming conventions ---
Use camelCase for all names, both in Java, Javascript, CSS and HTML

--- Spaces, no tabs ---
Make sure your IDE is set to write 4 spaces when you press the tab-key. NOT a tab character.

--- Git and branching ---
NEVER work on the Master branch, this branch is for release versions only.
NEVER work on the dev branch, this is for complete and functional code only.
Whenever you want to work, use a seperate branch for that specific functionality, then, when it's done and functioning, you can merge it into the dev branch.
